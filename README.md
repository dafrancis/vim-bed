## Bed?

Basic Editor Defaults. Why's stuff like "line numbers" gotta be in a vimrc? I
expect that to be in there from the begining yo!

## You could literally put this all in .vimrc

You could, but that can be said of all vim plugins. However I'm the kind of
person who doesn't like cluttering my vimrc with things that **should already
be there in the first place**

## Sounds like a poor way to work

We all have our quirks. I just happen to have this one. Please let me have this

## Hey buddy. Tim Pope called, [and he wants a word with you][1]

Oh hey Tim! This isn't a rippoff of sensible.vim by the way. Think of it more
like Monopoly Junior. The rules are easier to understand, it plays a lot
differently to regular monopoly, and it has a theme park theme to it. (I have
yet to make this plugin more theme-parky but you know 2 out of 3 ain't bad)

The only disadvantage to Monopoly Junior is that none of the player pieces is a
metal dog. Which is similar to this plugin because this plugin doesn't have a
metal dog. I clearly haven't thought about this analogy very hard.

My point is that even though Monopoly and Monopoly Junior may look the same,
both are still board games, and being able to play one doesn't lock you out of
playing the other. You can play both! You can even mix the two together! That
way you can finally be a cool metal dog in a theme park overcharging visitors
as they board your overpriced rides like the capitalist (but adorable!) scum
you are.

## I have suggestions/This broke my vim/I disagree with some things

Patches welcome

## Where's the license?

I haven't decided on one yet. Please assume it's the vim one for now

`:help license`
